+ Project summary: Our goal is to compare two algorithms for recommender system. Specifically, we implement, compare and evaluate the performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization after the postprocessing of Kernel Ridge Regression. By comparison, the RMSE of Stochastic Gradient Descent given kernel ridge regression is 1.4659, while the RMSE of  Probabilistic Matrix Factorization given kernel ridge regression is 1.3984. Therefore, Probabilistic Matrix Factorization given kernel ridge regression is better.
